# Country-Guessing-Game
This is just a simple game where you can choose to either guess the capital (It randomly spits out a country and you have to write the capital)
or country (same thing but reversed)
It also uses a scoreboard so you can track your scores :D
Remember to use capital letters when writing!
(Also this is my first decent-sized project, so it is very noodly and might have some errors!)
